  <h3>Green Energy Transformation</h3>
  <p>
    Pyrolysis is a method of heating, which decomposes organic materials at temperatures between 400℃ and 650℃, 
    in an environment with limited oxygen. Pyrolysis is normally used to generate energy in the form of heat, 
    electricity or fuels, but it could be even more beneficial if cold plasma was incorporated into the process, 
    to help recover other chemicals and materials.
  </p>
  <p>Cold plasma pyrolysis makes it possible to convert waste plastics into hydrogen, methane and ethylene.</p>
